# Ang2Test

This project (I hope I can call it an project) was created for [SmartexLab](smartexlab.com). It's was written for 2 nights with tons of coffee and cola and without any knowledge of Angular before. Enjoy!

## First steps

First of all, install Node.js and npm. How? [Google!](http://google.com)

Then you have to install Angular CLI using you command prompt. For this just type `npm install -g @angular/cli`. This command installs Angular CLI globally, so you can use it everywhere. Sounds good, right?

And then (but if you do it before installing CLI it doesn't matter I think) you can clone this repo, go to cloned directory and type `npm i` or `npm install` in your command prompt to install all dependencies. 

## Development server

After all _first steps_ you can open use your command prompt for running dev server of this app. Type `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Also you can use flags like `-o` or `--open` for automatically open your browser dev server. And flag `-port <number>` for using another port instead of `4200`.

Aaaand one more thing. Dev server will automatically rebuilds the app when you change something in this files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Text above was generated by Angular in start, but it is a nice information, so i don't wanna delete it.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

Or just pass the [GETTING STARTED](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) Angular guide and [TUTORIAL](https://angular.io/tutorial) like me.
